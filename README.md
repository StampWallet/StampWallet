# StampWallet

StampWallet is a **digital wallet** that allows users to **collect** and **manage** loyalty cards from their favorite shops and retailers. Users can use the application to:

- Add new retailers to their card collection
- Collect stamps by making purchases from participating shops and retailers
- Track their progress towards earning rewards from each shop and retailer
- Redeem rewards once they have collected enough stamps

StampWallet also **provides tools** to set up your own **loyalty programme** if you are a retailer.

# Getting started

To use the StampWallet, simply:
1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/StampWallet/stamp-wallet`
2. Make sure you have installed `Node.js`, simply run `node -v` to verify Node.js installation on your system.
If you don't have Node.js installed, visit [this official Node.js site](https://nodejs.org/en) and download latest version.
3. Make sure you have installed `Expo CLI` - run `npm install -g expo-cli` and verify the installation using `npx expo -v`.
4. Make sure you have installed `yarn`. Again, simply run `yarn -v`. If you haven't installed `yarn` yet, run `npm install -g yarn`.
5. Install project dependencies using `yarn install`.
6. Run `yarn start`. This will open a browser window with the Expo developer tools. From here you can launch your app in an emulator or on a physical device by selecting the appropriate option.
**Alternatively** run `yarn android` or `yarn ios` - this will build and run the app in the specified emulator/simulator.
