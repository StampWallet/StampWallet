# StampWallet
StampWallet is an application that simplifies the management of loyalty cards for users. It serves as a centralized platform for organizing both virtual and local loyalty cards. 

## Description

StampWallet enables users to conveniently store and manage their loyalty cards in one place. It offers two types of cards: <b>*virtual cards and local cards*</b>. 

- <b>Virtual cards</b> are designed for small businesses that want to expand their loyalty programs. These cards are created within the StampWallet application and allow users to collect stamps and points. In return, users can enjoy unique benefits offered by the participating businesses. The virtual cards can be customized with business banners, icons, and the specified menu of benefits.

- <b>Local cards</b> on the other hand, represent established businesses such as *"Biedronka"* and *"Kaufland"*. Users can easily search for predefined local cards within the application and add them to their account.

One of the key features of <b>StampWallet</b> is that any user has the opportunity to become a loyalty program owner. They can create their own virtual loyalty program, extending the application's functionality to businesses of all sizes.

In addition, <b>StampWallet</b> facilitates transactions between business owners and users. Business owners can scan the virtual cards of users and assign them a specific amount of points, enhancing the interactive experience.
